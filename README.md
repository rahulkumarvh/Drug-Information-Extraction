# Drug-Information-Extraction

Indentifing and quickly understanding the medicine you need for yourself or someone who is sick can be a life saving, I have created a model using the PaddleOCR using which we can quickly indentify the medicine name and other essential details, this is helpful for the old age people who find it difficult to indentify the small texts. This comes espically handy in case of Tablet packages where its difficult to make out the text.
